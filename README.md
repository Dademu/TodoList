From this project, I have learned several key concepts and skills related to building a web application using ASP.NET Core 
and Entity Framework Core, as well as writing unit tests. Here's a summary of what I have learned:

Project Setup:

Creating a solution file to organize multiple projects.
Setting up projects for a web API, a class library for models, and a unit test project.
Model Creation:

Defining models to represent data entities in the application, such as the ToDoItem class.
API Development:

Creating API controllers to handle HTTP requests and responses.
Implementing controller methods for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the ToDoItem entities.
Utilizing Entity Framework Core for data access and manipulation within the API controllers.
Unit Testing:

Writing unit tests to verify the functionality of the ToDoItem class.
Understanding the importance of testing to ensure code correctness and reliability.
Using xUnit as the testing framework to define and execute unit tests.
Database Operations:

Setting up a database context to interact with the database.
Performing database operations such as querying, adding, updating, and deleting data using Entity Framework Core.
Dependency Injection:

Registering services such as the database context in the application's dependency injection container.
Injecting dependencies into controllers to facilitate loose coupling and improve testability.
Running the Project:

Using the .NET CLI commands to build and run the web application.
Accessing the application through a web browser or API testing tool like Postman.
Overall, this project has provided you with practical experience in developing a web API with ASP.NET Core, 
working with Entity Framework Core for database access, writing unit tests for ensuring code quality, and 
understanding fundamental concepts of web application development. 
These skills are essential for building robust and scalable applications in the .NET ecosystem.
